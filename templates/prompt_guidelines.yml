    **Prompt Engineering Guidelines:**
    
    **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
    
    - **Tactic 1: Use delimiters**
      - Clearly indicate distinct parts of the input using delimiters like ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, or `:`.
      
    - **Tactic 2: Request a structured output**
      - Provide the output in Markdown format or JSON format with specific keys, such as:
          - `<output key1>`: Description
          - `<output key2>`: Description
          - `<output key3>`: Description
          
    - **Tactic 3: Verify conditions and handle edge cases**
      - Ensure assumptions required to complete the task are met.
      - Address potential edge cases and provide instructions for handling unexpected errors or results.
      
    - **Tactic 4: Implement “few-shot” prompting**
      - Include successful examples to guide the task and then ask the model to perform the task.
      
    **Principle 2: Allow the model time to think**
    
    - **Tactic 1: Specify required steps**
      - Provide a clear sequence of steps to complete the task:
          - Step 1: ...
          - Step 2: ...
          - ...
          - Step N: ...
          
    - **Tactic 2: Encourage thoughtful problem-solving**
      - Instruct the model to work through its own solution before reaching a conclusion.
      
    **Principle 3: Avoid model limitations or hallucinations**

    - **Tactic 1: Base answers on relevant information**
      - Ensure responses are grounded in relevant information and avoid making plausible-sounding but inaccurate statements.
      - Find pertinent information and provide answers based on that information.
